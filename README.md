# BITS_Document_Interaction_Dissertation_Project
Interactive Chatbots are fastly becoming new research areas in current era of
Information Science. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in document data
interaction marks a paradigm shift in how organizations process, analyze, and derive
insights from vast textual repositories.

The broad range of our project include developing a chatbot that interacts with
documents such as books, legal documents, and other important files. The chatbot will leverage 
LangChain’s loader, OpenAI Embeddings, and GPT to provide responses based on the document content.
Also, it includes current Artificial intelligence, Information retrieval and extraction
techniques.

LangChain’s loader is our first point of discussion, it is an all-purpose tool used to
load various document types, hence aiding in streamlining data preparation. Next,
the analysis explores how OpenAI Embeddings leverage vector representations of
high dimensionality to convert text into numbers so as to be able to carry out
similarity comparisons and observe semantic relationships.
